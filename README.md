This Application is made using React. It has proper UI.

When the use is set to false, clicking on write option in navbar will bring to Register page and in place of user icon, Login and Register will be screen, which will bring the user to Login and Register page.

The write option in navbar will allow the user to write a blog and search icon will bring the user to a page where the user can search by title.

Every post's title is clickable and lead the user to individual blogs.
